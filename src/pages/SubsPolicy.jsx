        <h2>Refund and Cancellation Policy:</h2>
        <p>
    Welcome to “ InkJetCare” Refund Policy. For subscription-based plans, a full
    refund will be issued if  InkJetCare has not been able to resolve even a
    single issue for you within the first 30 days of the subscription. If there
    are one or more resolved issues, the fees for the Subscription Service will
    not be refundable. Notwithstanding this,  InkJetCare, at its sole discretion
    and on a case-by-case basis, may agree to a refund of Subscription fees after
    deducting charges for servicing the Customer.
</p>
<p>
    For incident-based plans, you will be eligible for a refund when any of the
    following criteria are met InkJetCare
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have all the prerequisites required to resolve the problem.</li>
    <li>The issue was not resolved until the time the account was active.</li>
    <li>30 days have not passed since the issue was last worked on by a  InkJetCare technician.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Service Plans:</h3>
<p>
    You may order Services by submitting Plan Orders through the  InkJetCare
    Websites or by calling  InkJetCare. Once  InkJetCare accepts the Plan Order
    submitted by you, you will receive an email from  InkJetCare at the
    email address that you provided as part of the Registration Process for the
    Services.  InkJetCare is not responsible for rendering Services in connection
    with any Plan Order that it has not accepted. Upon acceptance by  InkJetCare of
    a Plan Order, you will have a Service Plan.
</p>

<h3>Undertaking:</h3>
<p>
    Subject to the Terms and Conditions, and other terms specific to each
    Service Plan,  InkJetCare will address your query using commercially
    reasonable efforts in providing appropriate solutions under the Services. In
    most cases,  InkJetCare will attempt problem diagnosis and a solution through
    chat, email, or other means as it deems most appropriate under the
    circumstances, including remote access. You understand that if remote access
    is used on your computer, there will be no residual software from the remote
    session; however, there may be a text file placed on your computer that will
    explain the work that was done on your computer. If such a text file is
    placed on your computer, you have the option to either save the file for
    future reference or to delete it. All undertakings under Service Plans are
    subject to  InkJetCare’s Limited Warranty, which is set forth below. You
    agree to pay all Services Fees and any other applicable fees/charges as set
    out in the relevant Plan Order in accordance with the Payment Terms provided
    below.
</p>

<h3>Payment:</h3>
<p>
    Services against any Plan Order will be available once you have made payment
    for Services according to the requirements of the corresponding Plan Order.
     InkJetCare has no obligation to render Services under any Service Plan if
    the payments required under any Plan Order have not been made. You
    understand that certain Service Plans may have fees including, but not
    limited to “Service Fee” and/or “Activation Fee” payable either on an annual
    basis (“Annual Payment Plan”) or on a monthly basis (“Recurring Payment
    Plan”). Subject to the applicable Term Plan, all payments under the Annual
    Plan shall be made upfront at the time of commencement of the subscription
    cycle.
</p>
<p>
    For payments under the Recurring Payment Plan, apart from the monthly
    installments of the Service Fee payable over a one (1) year payment term,
    you may be charged an additional non-refundable Activation Fee at the time
    of registration, as specified in the Plan Order. The fee (including
    Activation Fee) will not be refunded in case of cancellation of the Service
    Plan unless otherwise stated in the Plan Order.
</p>
<p>
    All fees under this clause or a relevant Plan Order are payable at the time
    of commencement of the Service Plan. When you purchase the Service, you
    agree to a specific price and plan, which may be for a term of one, two, or
    three years (“Term Plan”). All terms of Service Fee and/or any other fee
    payable under any mode of payment for a Subscription shall be set forth in
    the applicable Plan Order. Similarly, some plans may offer a discount on the
    Service if you sign up for other  InkJetCare services (“Bundle Discount”).
    You agree to maintain your Service and the bundled services for the
    applicable term. If you signed up for a Term Plan or a Bundle Discount, the
    price available with those plans is valid until one of the following occurs:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Term Plan expires.</li>
    <li>You drop one of the  InkJetCare services you were required to purchase to
        receive the special rate as notified to  InkJetCare.</li>
    <li>You terminate the agreement/Service Plan before the expiry of the relevant
        term. Credit Card Billing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You may be asked to provide us with a credit card number from a card issuer
    that we accept in order to activate your Service. You hereby authorize  InkJetCare
    to charge and/or place a hold on your credit card with respect to any
    unpaid charges for Services or any related equipment. You authorize the
    issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts described herein without
    requiring a signed receipt. You agree that these charges are to be accepted
    as authorization to the issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts
    described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that these
    charges are to be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the credit card
    to pay all such amounts. You authorize  InkJetCare and/or any other company
    that bills products or services, or acts as billing agent for  InkJetCare, to
    continue to attempt to charge and/or place holds with respect to all sums
    described herein, or any portion thereof, to your credit card until such
    amounts are paid in full.
</p>
<p>
    You agree to provide  InkJetCare with updated credit card information upon
     InkJetCare’s request and any time the information you previously provided is
    no longer valid.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that neither  InkJetCare nor any  InkJetCare
    affiliated company will have any liability whatsoever for any non-sufficient
    funds or other charges incurred by you as a result of such attempts to
    charge and/or place holds on your credit card. If you mistakenly provide a
    debit card number instead of a credit card number, you authorize all
    charges described herein to be applied to such debit card unless and until
    you provide a credit card number. In the event you are enrolled, or later
    enroll, in an automatic payment or electronic funds transfer plan, you agree
    that all sums described herein may be charged, at  InkJetCare’s option, to
    the account number provided for such automatic payment or electronic funds
    transfer plan.
</p>
<p>
    When payment is made by credit card or debit card, payment will also be
    subject to the terms and conditions established by the credit or debit card
    issuer. If charges cannot be processed through your credit card, or if your
    bank draft or electronic funds transfer is returned for insufficient funds,
    we may, at our discretion, charge you an additional fee.
</p>
