            the right to suspend or terminate Subscriber’s Subscription Services. In

            <h3>GeeksonWheel Care RESPONSE PROCESS</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a Customer &amp;/or SMB Contact requests service, our staff enters a
            trouble ticket into a tracking system http://helpdesk.InkJetCare. The
            system automatically generates a ticket number and sends the customer an
            e-mail acknowledging that a trouble ticket has been created. Keep in mind
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Responses are provided during normal business hours.</li>
            <li>
              Timeframes represent a best effort; delays may occur when products must
              be ordered or vendors engaged.
            </li>
            <li>
              With equipment orders (e.g., laptops, smart phones), our staff is
              responsible for providing specs and quotes within the established
              response timeframe. The timing of equipment delivery is beyond our
              control.
            </li>
            <li>Problems may be resolved remotely.</li>
            <li>
              When computers and smart phones are off site, our staff may not be able
              to adhere to the published response times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Problems caused by issues not within our staff’s control, such as
              building electrical failures, will be addressed as quickly as possible
              but are not held to the response timeframe.
