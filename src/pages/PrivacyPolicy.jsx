        <strong>Registration and Transactions:</strong> Any information you provide to us when establishing or updating an account, purchasing service plans, or requesting information (e.g., name, address, email address, and telephone number) is stored in private files on our secure web server and internal systems. This information is utilized to deliver services to you.

Cookies help us make our site more responsive to your needs, delivering a better and personalized experience. Cookies are typically stored on your computer’s hard drive and are used to track your navigation through the pages within  InkJetCare’s website. Additionally,  InkJetCare uses cookies to manage support requests and to identify whether you have previously visited our site, allowing registered users to avoid re-entering information during subsequent visits.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <h3>Does  InkJetCare disclose your personal identifiable information?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Please be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to comply with legal obligations or to protect the users of our website, the site itself, or the public.  InkJetCare does not sell, rent, or trade your email address to third parties. However, we may engage third parties to assist us in providing services, such as fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, and managing emails. If personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, email address, telephone number) is shared with any of these third parties, we will ensure that such information is kept confidential.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>What are my responsibilities in protecting my personal information?</h3>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Account Security:</strong> If any of the services require you to open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing accurate and current information. You will also select a password and username. You are fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Moreover, you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify  InkJetCare immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach.  InkJetCare will not be liable for any loss you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by  InkJetCare or another party due to someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else’s account at any time without the permission of the account holder. We encourage you to keep your personal information accurate and up to date. To do this, we provide you the option to update or modify your personal information, including billing and shipping information, by logging into your account. When you create or change your account, we will send a confirmation email regarding the changes and options selected.  InkJetCare periodically sends out an email newsletter, and you can choose whether to subscribe when creating your account. If you later decide not to receive the newsletter, you can unsubscribe at any time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Forgotten or Stolen Information:</strong> If you have forgotten your password, we provide a mechanism to email your password to you. Since the “forgot my password” feature sends your password to the email address you used for registration, do not use an email address accessible by others if you wish to keep your  InkJetCare account information private. Always exercise caution when providing any personally identifiable information about yourself or your children in any communication services.  InkJetCare does not control or endorse the content, messages, or information found in any communication services and specifically disclaims any liability related to these services.
    </li>
</ul>

    <li>
        <strong>Onward Transfer:</strong>  InkJetCare may transfer your personal information to a third party acting as  InkJetCare’s agent, ensuring that the third party provides at least the same level of privacy protection required by relevant principles or applicable law.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Access:</strong>  InkJetCare provides individuals access to their personal information held by us. Individuals may correct, amend, or delete any inaccurate information, except where the cost or effort of providing access would be disproportionate to the privacy risks involved or where the rights of other individuals would be compromised.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong>  InkJetCare takes reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our website has safeguards in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the data you provide, with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our website,  InkJetCare uses industry-standard SSL encryption to enhance data transmission security. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, so we urge you to take precautions to protect your data when online. Change your passwords regularly, use a combination of letters and numbers, and ensure you are using a secure browser.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Integrity:</strong>  InkJetCare will collect personal information that is relevant for its intended purposes. We take reasonable steps to ensure that this data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and up to date.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Third Party Sites:</strong>  InkJetCare’s website contains links to other sites operated by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites. We will not share your personal information with third-party websites. Some of these sites may be co-branded with a  InkJetCare logo, although they are not operated or maintained by us. While we carefully choose our business partners,  InkJetCare is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party operated websites. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of these third-party or co-branded websites.
